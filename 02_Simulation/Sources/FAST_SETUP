Follow these steps to get application up and running in no time:
1. Install Domoticz on port 127.0.0.1:8888 (or launch it on that address)
- If you for some reason can not do that, navigate to BedroomAgent and update `domoticzBaseUrl` property so it points to address of your choice.
2. Use IntelliJ to open this project
3. Upon opening project in IntelliJ click 'Import changes' in Maven dialog or just manually re-import pom.xml file
4. Add run configuration with following properties:
    - Main class: jade.Boot
    - Program arguments: -gui "WorldAgent:Agents.WorldAgent;"
    // This means that jade.Boot class will be launched when you hit 'Run project', jade.Boot benefits from having
    // reference to starting Agent, which in our case is WorldAgent under Agents package. WorldAgent then spawns other
    // all the other agents required for application to run.
5. Start configuration you just created
